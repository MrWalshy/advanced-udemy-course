# Animations with CSS

## Why do Animations matter?
- Animations draw attention
- They can help with accessiblity
- Sleight of hand, animations provide something for the user (even if not connected to the backend)
- Transitions, this helps highlight actions that are linked to each other
- Using modern features can make your website look more modern (attracting more users)
- Planning how animations should move is hard, implementing is easier

## Vendor Prefixes
- Vendor Prefixes allows non-standard/experiemental CSS to be run on multiple browsers
- Vendor Prefixes change quite frequently
- Use an auto-prefixer such as: autoprefixer.github.io
- -webkit- (Chrome, Safari, Opera, Most iOS browsers)
- -moz- (Firefox)
- -o- (Old, pre-webkit, versions of Opera)
- -ms- (IE or Older versions of Edge, Edge recently switched to the Chromium engine)
